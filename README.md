# Framed

The Framed profiler is a hobby project that measures various counters across
sections of your code and displays them visually. It currently only has direct
support for C and C++.  It consists of two parts: a small [stb]-style single
header file library for capturing counters, and a graphical visualizer for
displaying the counters.

Gathering of counters happens by manually adding a minimal amount of markup to
your code. This takes care of collecting counters and sending them over to the
visualizer.

Currently the only supported counter is [RDTSC], but more will be added later.


## Installation

Clone the repository and its submodules to wherever you like. Then read the
section below that corresponds with your operating system.

### Linux

You can either build with Clang or GCC. The following dependencies need to be
installed before building:

* SDL2

Open a terminal and navigate to the root of the project. Run the following
commands to compile using Clang. Equivalent scripts exist for
compiling with GCC.

```
script/build_clang.sh release
```

There will now be a `build` folder in the root of the project, and it will
contain a program named `framed`.

### MacOS

Framed currently does not support running on MacOS. As neither of us have a
Mac, it is unlikely that we will add support for it.

### Windows

Building on Windows requires a command line with the ability to call MSVC.
This can be achieved by either running `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS
<year>` in the start menu or by running `vcvarsall.bat x64` provided by
Microsoft's C/C++ build tools.  Navigate to the root of the repository and run
the following command:

```
script\build_msvc release
```

There will now be a `build` folder in the root of the project, and it will
contain a program named `framed.exe`.


## Usage

To profile your application, add the following two lines to one of your source
files.

```c
#define FRAMED_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "framed.h"
```

This will generate the implementation of the library. To then use the markup in
any other files, you now only have to include `framed.h` in it.

Before any actual profiling can be done, you need to initialize the library.
This has to be done before using any other part of the API. Initialization
takes care of connecting to the visualizer and potentially waiting for the
connection to be established before giving back control to your program. This
is done in the following way:

```c
Framed_B32 wait_for_connection = true;
framed_init(wait_for_connection);
```

When your program is done profiling, it might not have sent all of the data to
the visualizer yet. To ensure this is done, you can call `framed_flush()`
before your program exits.

The API for collecting counters consists of two functions at its core:
`framed_zone_begin(NAME)` to start a new zone named `NAME`, and
`framed_zone_end()` to end it. Note that you have to call `framed_zone_end()`
at all exit points of your function, or else the event will not be recorded.

Here is a complete example. There are more complex ones available in the
[examples] folder.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This has not yet been tested because the project is not fully functional yet.
> Test it before opening the project.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define FRAMED_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "framed.h"

int factorial(int n)
{
    framed_zone_begin("factorial");

    int result = 1;
    if (n > 1)
    {
        result = n * factorial(n - 1);
    }

    framed_zone_end();
    return result;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    framed_init(true);
    framed_zone_begin("main");

    int x = factorial(10);
    printf("10! = %d\n", x);

    framed_zone_end();
    framed_flush();
    return 0;
}
```
